# RMY: Representative Meteorological Year Generator

Anomaly-driven generation of Representative Meteorological Year (RMY) weather files with embedded extreme events, including **heatwaves** and **cold spells**. This method preserves core TMY characteristics while adding realistic severe climate conditions to support robust design evaluations.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the following from the repo root:
```bash
python rmy_generation.py
```

## 🧪 Usage Guidance

You can run the full RMY pipeline via:

```bash
python rmy_generation.py
```

Make sure your folder structure matches:
- `EPWs/base/` → contains the base TMY file (1 file only)
- `EPWs/epws/` → contains full set of AMY EPWs
- `final/` → RMY weather file + event summaries will be saved here
